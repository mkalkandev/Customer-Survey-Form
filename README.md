Continuing development
This was my third form project with HTML and CSS and I am happy with the result. This time I tried to learn new things, so I tried to structure HTML better, introduced flexbox and pseudo-classes on the CSS side. I also implemented the new reset.css. I will continue.

I plan to continue exploring this technology and learning more, so there will definitely be more projects related to this soon.
